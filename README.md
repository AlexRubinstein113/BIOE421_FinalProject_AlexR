Posture Detection Device

It is able to monitor upper body posture through detecting a change of more than 10 degrees from a currently set upper body angle. 
The device is also able to detect if the user is prone by sensing if it is oriented in a specific way. 
Alarms will activate for both cases, with the posture alarm having a visual and auditory component. 

Instructions:
Hold down the left button for 1 second to set target angle. The device will beep and flash blue.
Hold down the right button for 3 seconds to turn on or off posture detection. The device will beep when in prone position. 
Move the switch right for a shorter and higher posture alarm, and to the left for a longer and lower alarm.
